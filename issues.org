* description

Interactive visualization of flowfields. Point forces (and later force dipoles) can
be moved around while the flowfield is recalculated.
Therefore an svg visualization library is implemented.

* svg library

** centered objects[0/1]

All svg object shall be positioned at the origin. The orientation and position, as well
as the scaling should be given as transformations.

- [ ] Those transformation need nice selectors.


* event library

Either find an event library or create a very slim one.
